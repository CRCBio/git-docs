Module 5 - Advanced Git and GitHub Concepts
===========================================
As you become more proficient with Git and GitHub, there are several advanced 
concepts and practices that can enhance your bioinformatics work.

Git Tags
--------
Tags are a way to mark specific points in your project's history, often used 
for version releases. You can create tags to signify important milestones or 
versions of your bioinformatics software.

Gitignore
---------
In bioinformatics, you often work with large datasets and files that you don't 
want to include in your Git repository. The ``.gitignore`` file allows you to 
specify which files or directories should be excluded from version control, 
keeping your repository clean and efficient.

GitHub Actions
--------------
For bioinformatics projects, continuous integration and continuous deployment 
(CI/CD) can be vital. GitHub Actions is a feature that automates testing, 
building, and deployment of your code whenever changes are made, ensuring that 
your bioinformatics software remains reliable and up to date.

Git Best Practices
------------------
Developing a set of best practices for your bioinformatics projects can help 
maintain code quality and ensure effective collaboration. Here are some 
guidelines we use at CRCBio:

#. Commit Messages

   * Use meaningful and concise commit messages.
   * Start with a brief one-line summary that explains the change.
   * Provide additional details or context in the body of the commit message 
     when necessary.
   * Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix a bug" instead of "Fixed a bug") for 
     consistency.

#. Branching Strategies
   
   * Adopt a branching model that suits your project's needs.
   * Use feature branches to work on new features or bug fixes.
   * Keep the main branch stable and deployable.
   * Regularly merge or rebase feature branches with the main branch to 
     incorporate changes and resolve conflicts.

#. Project Organization
   
   * Follow a consistent directory structure.
   * Separate code, data, documentation, and configuration files into distinct 
     directories.
   * Use meaningful names for directories and files.
   * Include a README file with project documentation, setup instructions, 
     and usage guidelines.

#. Version Control for Data

   * Data Version Control (DVC) is a tool specifically designed for versioning 
     data files in Git repositories. It allows you to track changes to data 
     files separately from code.
   * For larger data files, Git LFS can be employed to store data outside the 
     Git repository while still versioning them. It integrates seamlessly with 
     Git.
   * In commit messages or data documentation, describe why data changes were 
     made, such as updates, corrections, or additions.
   * Maintain an organized data pipeline by separating raw and processed data 
     files.

#. Code Review

   * Define clear steps for how code reviews are conducted, including who 
     reviews the code and the criteria for approval.
   * Code reviews should aim to improve code quality, identify bugs, ensure 
     compliance with coding standards, and share knowledge.

#. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

   * Set up CI/CD pipelines from the beginning of your project to catch issues 
     early in the development process.
   * Use automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) to verify that 
     code changes are functional and do not introduce regressions.
   * Containerization technologies like Docker can ensure that the development 
     and production environments are consistent.
   
#. Documentation

   * Every project should have a README file that provides an overview, 
     installation instructions, usage examples, and contact information.
   * Include detailed instructions on how to set up and run your bioinformatics 
     tools or analyses. Specify any required software packages, libraries, or 
     dependencies.
   * Document the data sources, file formats, and data processing steps. This 
     ensures that others can reproduce your results accurately.
   * If your project is hosted on GitHub, consider using Markdown syntax to 
     format your README, making it visually appealing and easily navigable.
   * Add comments within your code to explain complex algorithms, data 
     structures, and important functions.
   * Create user manuals or guides that explain how to use the software or 
     tools you've developed.
   * Keep documentation in sync with code changes and ensure that it remains 
     accurate and relevant.

#. Issue Tracking

   * Use GitHub Issues to prioritize tasks, bugs, and feature requests, 
     ensuring that important work is not overlooked and that team members can 
     collaborate effectively.
   * Create templates for different types of issues (e.g., bug reports, feature 
     requests) to standardize reporting.
   * Assign issues to team members and prioritize them to focus on high-impact 
     work.
   * Use issue comments to discuss proposed solutions, track progress, and 
     share information among team members.
