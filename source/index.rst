Welcome to CRCBio's Git documentation!
======================================

Bioinformatics, a multidisciplinary field at the intersection of biology and
data science, is continually advancing with the advent of high-throughput
sequencing technologies and the ever-growing volume of biological data. 
In this dynamic landscape, efficient collaboration, version control, and
data management are indispensable for bioinformaticians. Enter Git and GitHub,
powerful tools that offer a comprehensive solution to these challenges. This
training material serves as a guide to familiarize bioinformaticians with Git
and GitHub, from the fundamentals to advanced practices tailored to the unique
needs of the field. Whether you're developing bioinformatics software,
analyzing genomics data, or contributing to open-source projects, mastering Git
and GitHub will elevate your capabilities and help you thrive in the
bioinformatics community.
